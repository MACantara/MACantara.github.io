            <p>
                Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a description of standard objects and modules, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/index.html#library-index" target="_blank">The Python Standard Library</a>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.11/reference/index.html#reference-index" target="_blank">The Python Language Reference</a> gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.11/extending/index.html#extending-index" target="_blank">Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.11/c-api/index.html#c-api-index" target="_blank">Python/C API Reference Manual</a>. There are also several books covering Python in depth.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/index.html#library-index" target="_target">The Python Standard Library</a>.

            <p>
                If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python is just the language for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
            <li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
            <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.\
            </p>
            <p>
                By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that you are all excited about Python, you’ll want to examine it in some more detail. Since the best way to learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the next chapter, the mechanics of using the interpreter are explained. This is rather mundane information, but essential for trying out the examples shown later.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples, beginning with simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.

            <article id="invoking-the-interpreter">
                <h3>2.1. Invoking the Interpreter</h3>
                <p>
                    The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.11 on those machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:
                </p>
                <code>python3.11</code>
                <p>
                    to the shell. Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., /usr/local/python is a popular alternative location.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.11/using/windows.html#windows-store" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, the python3.11 command will be available. If you have the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.11/using/windows.html#launcher" target="_blank">py.exe launcher</a> installed, you can use the py command. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.11/using/windows.html#setting-envvars" target="_blank">Excursus: Setting environment variables</a> for other ways to launch Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: quit().
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support the <a href="https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html" target="_blank">GNU Readline</a> library. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing Control-P to the first Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix <a href="#interactive-input-editing-and-history-substitution">Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution</a> for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if ^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a <i>script</i> from that file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A second way of starting the interpreter is python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s) in <i>command</i>, analogous to the shell’s -c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote <i>command</i> in its entirety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked using python -m module [arg] ..., which executes the source file for <i>module</i> as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode afterwards. This can be done by passing -i before the script.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All command line options are described in Command line and environment.

                <h4>2.1.1. Argument Passing</h4>
                <p>
                    When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the argv variable in the sys module. You can access this list by executing import sys. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, sys.argv[0] is an empty string. When the script name is given as '-' (meaning standard input), sys.argv[0] is set to '-'. When -c command is used, sys.argv[0] is set to '-c'. When -m module is used, sys.argv[0] is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after -c command or -m module are not consumed by the Python interpreter’s option processing but left in sys.argv for the command or module to handle.

                <h4>2.1.2. Interactive Mode</h4>
                <p>
                    When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in <i>interactive mode</i>. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the <i>primary prompt</i>, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:
                </p>
                <code>$ python3.11 Python 3.11 (default, April 4 2021, 09:25:04)
                    [GCC 10.2.0] on linux
                    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
                    >>>
                </code>
                <p>
                    Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look at this if statement:
                </p>
                <code>>>> the_world_is_flat = True
                    >>> if the_world_is_flat:
                    ...&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp print("Be careful not to fall off!")
                    ...
                    Be careful not to fall off!
                </code>

                <h3>2.2. The Interpreter and Its Environment</h3>
                <article id="source-code-encoding">
                    <h4>2.2.1. Source Code Encoding</h4>
                    <p>
                        By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the <i>first</i> line of the file. The syntax is as follows: 
                    </p>
                    <code># -*- coding: encoding -*-</code>
                    <p>
                        where <i>encoding</i> is one of the valid <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/codecs.html#module-codecs" target="_blank">codecs</a> supported by Python.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your source code file should be:
                    </p>
                    <code># -*- coding: cp1252 -*-</code>
                    <p>
                        One exception to the <i>first line</i> rule is when the source code starts with a UNIX “shebang” line. In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:
                    </p>
                    <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
                        # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-</code>

            <p>
                In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can toggle the display of prompts and output by clicking on >>> in the upper-right corner of an example box. If you hide the prompts and output for an example, then you can easily copy and paste the input lines into your interpreter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.
            </p>
            <p>Sone examples:</p>
            <code># this is the first comment
                spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      # ... and now a third!
                text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."

                <h3>3.1. Using Python as a Calculator</h3>
                <p>
                    Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, >>>. (It shouldn’t take long.)
                </p>
                <article id="numbers">
                    <h4>3.1.1. Numbers</h4>
                    <p>
                        The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:
                    </p>
                    <code>>>> 2 + 2
                        4
                        >>> 50 - 5*6
                        20
                        >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
                        5.0
                        >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
                        1.6
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:
                    </p>
                    <code>>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
                        5.666666666666667
                        >>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
                        5
                        >>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division

                        With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers:
                    </p>
                    <code>>>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared
                        25
                        >>> 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7
                        128

                        If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error:
                    </p>
